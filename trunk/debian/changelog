libdatrie (0.2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix broken Vcs-Browser field.
  * New upstream release, with symbols versioning added
    - debian/libdatrie0.symbols: Update symbols tags to "DATRIE_0.2" as per
      upstream. This is not considered ABI breakage, as unversioned calls are
      still resolved to the same symbols as versioned ones.

libdatrie (0.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * VCS moved from CVS to SVN; update Vcs-* fields accordingly.
  * New upstream version, with ABI breakage
    - Rename binary packages according to SONAME change, to allow run-time
      coexistence with old version: libdatrie1, libdatrie1-bin
    - Rename libdatrie0-dev to libdatrie-dev, and conflicts with
      libdatrie0-dev, as both versions share the same headers location;
      this should be the package naming scheme from now on
    - Ditto to libdatrie-doc
  * Shared lib updates:
    - debian/rules:
      + Bump shlib dep to 0.2.0, and shlib package is now libdatrie1
    - debian/libdatrie1.symbols:
      + Update symbols, setting minver to 0.2.0 for all symbols
  * Bump debhelper compat to level 7
    - Bump debian/compat to 7
    - Build-dep on debhelper (>= 7)
    - debian/rules:
      + Replace obsoleted 'dh_clean -k' with 'dh_prep'
      + Remove *-stamp clean-ups in clean target, as dh_clean now does it
  * debian/libdatrie-doc.docs:
    - Install README.migration provided by upstream
  * debian/copyright:
    - Update format to proposal rev 454
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes needed)

libdatrie (0.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Build-Depends-Package info to libdatrie0.symbols and bump dpkg-dev
    Build-deps to (>= 1.14.13) accordingly. Thanks Loïc Minier.
  * Fix CVSROOT in Vcs-Cvs, so it really works with debcheckout.
  * debian/libdatrie0-doc.doc-base: Correct doc-base section (Programming).
  * debian/rules:
    - Update config.{guess,status} before configure, and clean them up on
      clean target, so the changes are not included in .diff.gz
    - Use 'make -C $dir' instead of 'cd $dir; make'
    - Do not build/install doc on binary-arch
  * debian/copyright:
    - Remove inline license file referals, and use usual Debian text at the
      bottom instead
    - Update format to current proposal
  * debian/watch: Fix watch pattern so that only *.tar.gz is matched, not
    *.tar.gz.md5sum.
  * Use short description for libdatrie0, and add that it's usually
    auto-installed.
  * debian/control:
    - Add DM-Upload-Allowed
    - Bump Standards-Versions to 3.8.0 (no changes needed)

libdatrie (0.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Revert manual calls to doxygen and rely on configure
