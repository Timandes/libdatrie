libdatrie

0.2.10 (2015-10-20)
======
- Correctly check doxygen version on configure.
  (Thanks Petr Gajdos for the patch.)
- Optimization on AlphaMap mapping.
  (contributing to 0.2% less run time for LibThai word breaking)

0.2.9 (2015-05-03)
=====
- Fix binary file opening on Windows
  (Thanks phongphan.p for the report and initial patch.)
- Fix infinite loop on empty trie iteration.
  (Thanks Sergei Lebedev for the report and analysis.)
- Micro-optimization with LIKELY/UNLIKELY hints.
  (contributing to 4.76% faster dictionary loading, 1.95% faster
  word breaking for LibThai)
- Improved error handling
- 'trietool-0.2' utility is renamed to just 'trietool'
- Improved documentation
  (Thanks edgehogapp for the suggestion.)
- No timestamp on Doxygen-generated doc
  (Thanks Debian Reproducible)

0.2.8 (2014-01-10)
=====
- Fix compiler warnings in test suites.
- Fix edge-case error on alphabet set of size 255.
  (Thanks Naoki Youshinaga for the report, test case, and analysis.)
- Fail trie operations on non-alphabet inputs, rather than silently allowing
  them to sneak in as false keys.
  (Thanks Naoki Youshinaga for the suggestion.)
- Improved documentation.

0.2.7.1 (2013-10-22)
=======
- Bump library versioning to reflect API addition.
  (Change missing in previous release)

0.2.7 (2013-10-21)
=====
- Fix portability issue with non-GCC compilers.
  [Thanks Gabi Daver for the report and fix (via Mikhail Korobov).]
- Fix compiler warnings.
- New utility API for comparing AlphaChar strings.
- Add test suites.
- Update doxygen doc generation.

0.2.6 (2013-01-23)
=====
- New API trie_state_walkable_chars() for breadth-first traversal.
- New class TrieIterator for callback-free enumeration.
- Improved performance on key enumeration.
- Improved AlphaMap range merging.
- Bug fixes.
[Many thanks to Mikhail Korobov for improvements in this version.]

0.2.5 (2011-11-04)
=====
- Fix missing 'extern "C"' in header file. [Patch from Aurimas ÄŒernius]
- Minor documentation fix.

0.2.4 (2010-06-30)
=====
- Close file on saving trie. [Bug report from Xu Jiandong]
- Add trie_store_if_absent() API which fails on adding duplicated key.
  This is useful for preventing race condition in multi-thread applications.
  [Suggestion from Dan Searle]
- Add trie_fread() and trie_fwrite() APIs for reading/writing trie data in
  an open file, allowing trie to be embeded as part of a bigger file.
  [Suggestion from NIIBE Yutaka]

0.2.3 (2010-02-27)
=====
- More robustness against corrupted trie files.
- License clarification in individual source files.

0.2.2 (2009-04-29)
=====
- Support building with linkers without symbol versioning supports,
  including Mac, Cygwin, MinGW.
- Support other iconv implementations than that's in glibc, for Mac and MinGW.

0.2.1 (2009-04-05)
=====
- Fix errors in documentation
- Symbol versioning to ease upgrade across SONAME
- Minor cleanups

0.2.0 (2009-03-24)
=====
- New APIs for performance: trie_state_copy(), trie_state_is_single()
- Clean-ups

0.1.99.2 (2008-12-15)
========
- More robust handling of alphabet ranges
- Allow co-existence with libdatrie0

- Adjusted API for non-file trie usage
- All data in one file, no more *.br and *.tl split
- Drop SBTrie wrapper; all features are merged into Trie
- Domain characters are now Unicode

  (shepmaster)

- Remove excessive documentation for private API's.
- Add the SBM file format documentation frequently asked for

0.1.2 (2007-08-25)
