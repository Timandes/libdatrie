libdatrie (0.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Build-Depends-Package info to libdatrie0.symbols and bump dpkg-dev
    Build-deps to (>= 1.14.13) accordingly. Thanks Loïc Minier.
  * Fix CVSROOT in Vcs-Cvs, so it really works with debcheckout.
  * debian/libdatrie0-doc.doc-base: Correct doc-base section (Programming).
  * debian/rules:
    - Update config.{guess,status} before configure, and clean them up on
      clean target, so the changes are not included in .diff.gz
    - Use 'make -C $dir' instead of 'cd $dir; make'
    - Do not build/install doc on binary-arch
  * debian/copyright:
    - Remove inline license file referals, and use usual Debian text at the
      bottom instead
    - Update format to current proposal
  * debian/watch: Fix watch pattern so that only *.tar.gz is matched, not
    *.tar.gz.md5sum.
  * Use short description for libdatrie0, and add that it's usually
    auto-installed.
  * debian/control:
    - Add DM-Upload-Allowed
    - Bump Standards-Versions to 3.8.0 (no changes needed)
