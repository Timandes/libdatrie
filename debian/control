Description: Development files for double-array trie library
 Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with
 O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as hashing,
 trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
 manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
 spelling dictionaries.
 .
 This library is an implementation of double-array structure for representing 
 trie, as proposed by Junichi Aoe. The details of the implementation can be 
 found at http://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html
 .
 This package contains the development libraries, header files and manpages
 you need to develop your programs using the datrie library.
